<p id="introduction">
    Originally conceived by mathematician and magician Martin Gardner, this program showcases the abilities of the "Missing Number" mentalism piece on a mathematically impossible scale. In this trick, you will generate a completely random number, think of a digit, and this program will try to deduce what digit is missing.
